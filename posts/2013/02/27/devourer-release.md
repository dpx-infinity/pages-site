I'm proud to announce the first release of **Devourer XML processing library**.

Devourer is a library for streaming XML processing. It is heavily inspired by
[Apache Digester](http://commons.apache.org/digester), and does essentially the same job, however,
it is different in usage and is completely different inside. It is described in detail in the
[official guide](/devourer/overview.html) which appeared on this site earlier. Several examples are
present there as well.

There are multiple things I'd like to extend and evolve in the library, so more releases will be
coming. Hope it will be useful to someone.
