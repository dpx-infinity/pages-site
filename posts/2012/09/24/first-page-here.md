Hello there. This is my first post at this newly created site.

I didn't have any kind of blog for a long time; in fact, I didn't even participated in any kind of social networks.
However, recently I've started encountering things I would have written about if I had a place for it.

Now I have one, namely this site, and I'll try and do my best to update it regularly. I sincerely hope that I
have something to write that would be useful to someone. In fact, this is my main reason for creating a blog.

Soon I will write several articles, mostly about some quirky problems I had to solve while working
on my projects. Turned out that their solutions were surprisingly difficult or even impossible to find
on the Internet, so they would be here just in case if someone needed them.

Cheers,

Vladimir Matveev.
